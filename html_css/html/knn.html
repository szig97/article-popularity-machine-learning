        <h3>Introduction</h3>

        <p>KNN, or K-Nearest Neighbors is a supervised machine learning model that is most frequently used for
          classification. The model looks at each data point to determine the distance between it and the other data
          points and then classifies the data points into their various groups. As a supervised model, the correct
          classification of each data point is know when the training model is initiated.
        </p>

        <br>
        <p>Initially, this dataset had a target value set that was defined in integers. This would work for a
          regression, but less so in a model that excels in classification, (although KNN can be used for regressions).
          To aid in the classification, our group choose to split data into specific percentile, 33% percentile and 66%
          percentile for three categories and 20%/40%/60%/80% percentiles for 5 categories. The analysis was done on the
          3-Category dataset and the 5-category dataset. Each set brought forth a new set of challenges. </p>

        <p>As part of implementing the KNN model, the data was scaled. Some of the data contained negative values and
          some data was a magnitude or two larger other data. For every parameter to be of equal consideration in our
          model, scaling all parameters was necessary. After the data prepped for our KNN model, the target data was
          categorized in a single column with value of [0, 1, 2] and [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] for the 3-Category and 5-category
          datasets respectively. Therefore, our output classes were one-hot encoded. </p>

        <h3>Model Comparison</h3>

        <P>many words</P>

        <P>more words</P>

        <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
        <p>In the end, the models in which one-hot encoding was not deployed yielded better accuracy. With enough
          neighbors, the accuracy was able to surpass the chance percentage of 33% or 20% for the two data sets. </p>

        <p>In the Random Forrest analysis, a feature importance analysis was done and it turns out that there are no
          clear features that can easily predict article popularity. This data is also very heavily skewed right which
          resulted in our percentiles being quite close together and ultimately the short differences between data
          points were not immediately obvious to the model; i.e. very hard to differentiate. This is the predominate
          theory as to why the one-hot encoded models performed so poorly. </p>
